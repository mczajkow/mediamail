TwitterBot is a Platform Bot that interacts with Twitter. Twitter supports multiple different query options. In this code, we provide one of three possible types of interaction: (a) Stream on keywords, (b) Stream on geographical locations of interest, (c) Stream on a set of follower IDs to track updates from. This package uses Tweepy to do the interactions with Twitter
